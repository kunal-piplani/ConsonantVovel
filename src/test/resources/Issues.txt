ISSUES WITH Current Implementation :

1) Not Working with  CAPITAL CHARCTER
2) NOT WORKING IF LENGHT IS 4
3) INSERATION ORDER IS NOT MAINTAINED
4) if same string Inserted 2 TImes Not Mentione dwhat to do ?

ENHANCEMENT :
1) created new method of vovels with LinkedList And LInked HAshmap  (to ensure Inserstion order is maintained )
2) Parameterized the function For Code Reuseablity .
3) Created 2 seperated method for Vowel and Consonants .

Drawback of Enhancement :
Used the Linked HashMap:  Time Complexity increase to NLOGN (but it is not that bad  )
